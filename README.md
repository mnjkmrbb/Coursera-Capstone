The notebook has data extracted from FourSquare API for each of the 5 Boroughs of New York City. These calls may fail or throw error. The .csv files are created out the previous data extraction and are available in the Venues Data_Borough.zip file. So the CSV files can used for further data analysis instead of making repeated API calls
